# AGENTS.md (Project Guidance)

This file defines repo-specific guidance for sessions started in `/Users/chronostriker1/git/LanraragiDesk`.

## Inheritance

- Workspace guidance: `/Users/chronostriker1/git/AGENTS.md`
- Home guidance: `/Users/chronostriker1/AGENTS.md`

## Local scope

- Keep only repo-specific rules, workflows, and pitfalls here.
- Put cross-repo rules in `/Users/chronostriker1/git/AGENTS.md`.

## Project Memory (Codex Managed)

- Purpose: Native macOS desktop client for LANraragi.
- Stack: Swift/Xcode project.
- Key files: `LanraragiDesk.xcodeproj`, `Sources/`, `Packages/`, `project.yml`.
- Useful commands:
  - Build (CLI): `xcodebuild -project LanraragiDesk.xcodeproj -scheme LanraragiDesk -configuration Debug build`
- Edit notes: treat `.derived/` and generated build artifacts as runtime output.

## End Project Memory

## Upstream AGENTS Sync Rule

- If new stable guidance discovered here applies to multiple git repos, update `/Users/chronostriker1/git/AGENTS.md` in the same task.
- If it applies across the home workspace, also update `/Users/chronostriker1/AGENTS.md` in the same task.
- Keep purely repo-specific details in this local project AGENTS file.
